            <!-- Widow neither gets socio-economic support nor do they get counselling and emotional support in distress from family and society. Indian widows are often invisible, not least in relation to their economic contribution and unpaid family work in household. In our country widows are deprived of getting pension schemes benefits due to corruption. They are facing numbers of problems in their life.

                <p>
                    Majority of Indian Windows are deprived of their inheritance rights. If a widow has adult sons, she may enjoy it but if she is child less or has only daughters she actually faces problems.

                <!-- <li>Victim of violence:</li>
                <p>
                    Widows are commonly accused of having caused her husband’s death. In addition in many parts of India, Particularly in tribal communities, widows are sometimes killed as witches. The underlying motivation is economic, the accusers tend to be the male relatives, and brother-in-law or step sons who want to control the land. Rape Forced marriage and sexual abuse are common problems in case of widows. Widows who have been raped and pregnant infected by STD are too ashamed to seek any professional help.

                <!-- <p>
                    Many widows come across economic hardship during their life. They are bound to send their children out to work to earn income instead of sending them to school for education. Some widows are forced to adopt prostitution as sources of income and get infected by STD easily.
                </p> -->
                <!-- <p>
                    Employment opportunities for windows are very low especially because of the limitations on mobility and gender division of labour. So the widows have to adjust with in-law’s family remaining engaged with-domestic chores and child rearing activities or to live with and adult son.
